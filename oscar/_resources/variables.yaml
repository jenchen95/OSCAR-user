# ==============================================================================
# OSCAR VARIABLE REGISTRY
# ==============================================================================
# DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
# This file centralizes all scientific metadata (scientific names, long names, 
# and units) away from the physical core engine (_core/).
#
# LONG-TERM ADVANTAGES:
# 1. Separation of Concerns: Physics equations stay in _core/, while reporting 
#    standards (CF-Conventions) stay here.
# 2. Interoperability: To adopt a new standard (e.g., CMIP7), you can simply 
#    swap this file for a 'cmip7_standard.yaml' without touching the physics.
# 3. Maintainability: Non-Python experts can update variable descriptions 
#    without risking bugs in the numerical solver.
